Remora Nucleo Hat PCB

Hardware PCB for a Nucleo F446RE Hat that can run Remora for 6 Axis CNC Machines

Firmware can be found in this repo: https://github.com/ben-jacobson/Remora-STM32F4xx-W5500

Uses Kicad 9. Currently in development, for now just SPI, UART and some SMPS regulators on board. Board layout is WIP, appears to fit mechanically but have not yet ordered to test this.
